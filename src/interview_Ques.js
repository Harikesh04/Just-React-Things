// Pure Component vs Higher Order Component



//  ** Pure Compnents: it takes props as input and don't have their own logic : eg cards, buttons, testimonials etc

// **  Higher Order Componets : Componets which recieve a component as an arguments and have its own logic which could be
// 1. which component will render
// 2.ui change
// 3.change in component on some need

// ?? with the help of hocs we prevents our application of making multiple components and make our code efficient
